The program implements the Calculator class which runs a simple calculator program through standard IO. 

The program prompts for the first operand, and then for the second operand. It then prompts the user to select the operation; addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division by entering 1 through 4 respectively. The program checks validity of the operator selection and re-prompts if the user makes an invalid entry. 

The program then performs the requested operation and outputs its result. 

The program prompts the user if they would like to perform another calculation. If the user enters "yes" (case sensitive) then the process repeats. Any entry other than "yes" will result in the program terminating. 

THe program will identify calculations which create a fractional answer and will round such answers to two decimal places. The program will also identify divide-by-zero errors and prompt for new inputs if such an operation is requested.
