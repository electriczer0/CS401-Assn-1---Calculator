Test Cases: 

Divide by 0
n1 is an integer. n2 is 0. operation is 4. 
Confirm that program catches divide by 0 error and prompts for new input.

Negative numbers
n1 and/or n2 are negative. 
Confirm that Scanner reads negative integers properly, and that output is correct. 

Fractional numbers
Operation is 4, N1 % N2 != 0. 
Confirm that the program conditionally formats the result output as a double with 2 decimal places; rounded appropriately. 

Continue Input
Confirm that entering "yes" correctly repeats the loop. Confirm that any other entry, including eg "YES" will break the loop.
